# Vaayu

1.Vaayu is a hardware and software integrated system.
2.Based on the concept of IoT. 
3.Topology of a mesh network consisting of multiple air pollution sensors that act as nodes in the network. 
4.Nodes send data to each other via M2M communication.
5.This data ultimately reaches a central base station which transmits the data to the cloud.
6.The data is then processed by a GIS, fed to a database and then served to a website or mobile app whenever requested.
7.Further advancements include analytics using Machine Learning to analyse traffic patterns based on pollution levels in a city and predicting air quality on a given day.
